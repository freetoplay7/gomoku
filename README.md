# gomoku

Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game also known as 'FIVE in a ROW'

In order to win, the player must connect five of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

There is an AI algorithm in this game that computes the best possible moves for itself and against you, the player. 

Pieces are placed using input strings, and the board is redrawn after each turn.
